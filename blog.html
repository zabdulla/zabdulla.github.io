        <h2>Good vs Great</h2>
        <p>
            Good throwers practice a lot. Obviously. They've seen how the disc moves in the wind. They know the shape they need to cut through it, and they know how to put that shape on the disc. They know how to put touch if the target is close, or how to throw to space if the reciver is moving at an angle. Thye know it because they've practiced it. And when the situation they've practiced comes, they can think on it and make the right throw.
        </p>
        <p>
            A great thrower doesn't think. The know. They've practiced every situation to the point that every wind and every distance is ingrained in there muscles, and without hesitation when they see their target and know they are open, the body does the rest.

        <h2>3-man mark</h2>
        <p>
            3-man mark can be a great drill or a waste of time. The difference is if the 3 players involved know the purpose of the drill. As with many drills, players often focus on winning the drill, instead of benifiting from it. 3 easy mistakes that I most often see.
            <li>The thrower settles for just getting the disc to the other guy</li>
            <li>The thrower throws it as the mark is running up</li>
            <li>The marker stands 2 steps off and forces a bad throw</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do these things you're wasting your time and your teammates time. When throwing a break throw in the game, the shape and spot matters. If 3-man mark is about beating the mark, then gettin the disc to the other guy is not enough. Your goal should be to first beat the mark with your speed, balance, pivots, and fakes. If you do beat them, know is the real challenge. Do you have the balance/consistency/quality of throw to get the disc to the otherside with the shape (inside/around/flat) you want? If not, it won't translate to the game.
